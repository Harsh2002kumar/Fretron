Steps to solve the problem:
user enter the numbers of flights
For each flight user to enter the number of coordinates.
Store the coordinates in a vector.
Define a Line2D class to represent line segments between consecutive coordinates of a flight.

Convert Coordinates to Line Segments:
For each flight, convert the coordinates into Line2D objects representing line segments 

Check for Intersections:
Compare each pair of line segments to check if they intersect.

Print Non-Intersecting Flight Paths:
Iterate through the flights and print the paths of those flights that do not have any intersecting line segments.

output:
there is no intersecting flight paths show in my code i don't know at which place my code in not running
