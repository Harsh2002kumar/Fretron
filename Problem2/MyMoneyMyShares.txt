Use a method to read input values (apple weights) from the user until a termination signal (e.g., -1) is entered.
Store all the input apple weights in a list or vector.
Sort the apple weights in descending order to distribute the heaviest apples first.
Compute the total weight of all apples by summing the values in the list.
